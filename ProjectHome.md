A platform for stock retrieval info and data mining for recommended stocks based on patterns of fundamental analysis values, with reprogrammable algorithms.

The project has 2 main utilities: fetcher and idigger itself. 1) fetcher is responsible for fetching (!) the stock data from different providers and storing is a database (SQLite); 2) idigger is responsible for sorting and applying "intelligenza" and output tables to extract conclusions from it.

It's far from perfect, as time permits. However, a working version is running at:

It regenerates all the pages every morning at around 5 a.m. BRT.
