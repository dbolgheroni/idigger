# A wrapper to run multiple instances of idigger with different conf
# files.
#
# Typically, a single conf file contains only related stocks since,
# historically, it doesn't make sense to compare the values idigger
# provides between all stocks available. EACH INVESTOR HAS ITS OWN
# CRITERIA.
#
# This script is just a reference to be modified for a specific need.  

# add new conf files here (without ".conf")
